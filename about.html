          <p class="title">About Design Errands</p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Design Errands is a series of design observations and essays about cognition by <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.institutnicod.org/membres/membres-statutaires/casati-roberto-directeur/?lang=fr">Roberto Casati</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/faculty/goffredo-puccetti.html">Goffredo Puccetti.</a> "Design Errands", as a project and an approach, hopes to encourage the practice of observing our surrounding environment and paying attention to how things, systems, spaces, etc. are designed, and from that, probing into how design shapes the way we think and act. 
            <br><br>
            Design Errands was originally in the form of a book; however, the pandemic has significantly hindered the publication process while also opened up opportunities for a digital reformation, hence this website. The website is designed by <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://vananhbui.com/">Van Anh Bui </a> and made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and p5.js. Focusing on the act of observing and recording instances of design in our surrounding environment, the website acts as a visual database of those observations and constantly stays open for contribution. Join the movement and report your design errands!

        Director of Institute Jean-Nicod in Paris, France 
        <br><br>
        Roberto Casati works on theoretical problems related to cognitive artifacts and external representations, publishing on maps, pictograms, drawings, perspectival models, queues, music notation, and educational (in particular digital) tools, in the framework of an extension and generalization of the "two modes” account of reasoning, that is meant to be an alternative to "extended mind" theories. The main aim is to investigate the cognitive mechanics underlying the use of artifacts (shifting, bridging, recycling, contracting...) in a unitary framework centered on the tradeoffs between representational advantages. Pointing out a third mode (instrument assisted cognition) and a fourth mode (instrument delegated cognition), he has mainly pursued the study of instrumental navigation without delegation (pre-GPS wayfinding). A number of training- and field- projects have been realized.
