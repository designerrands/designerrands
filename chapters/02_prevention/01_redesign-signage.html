        <p> Before asking what design is, we are asking how design works. That is, how are design products interpreted by mind like ours. That a reasonably good and workable theory of the mechanics of the mind is needed is the consequence of the fact that if you do not have a theory of how the mind works, you are likely to have a theory, and the latter is invariably a kind of blank slate account. <span class="cite" id="cite1"> Blank slate theories </span> <span class="ref" id="ref1"> Pinker </span> claim that your mind is a sheet of wax, totally virgin and undifferentiated at birth, and that experience will write on the wax, leaving traces that constitute your mental makeup.  
            <br><br>
            Today we know that things are more complicated, and we also know how much more complicated they are, but here we can make a very long story relatively short. A few theoretical results of recent cognitive science are particularly important for a discussion about design and its reception.  
            <br><br>
            The first is that perceptual systems build objects out of pieces that are found in the perceptual scene, and that they do it following their own logic, without listening much to other systems such as memory or the conceptual system. For instance, vision creates three objects, Head, Tail and Box, with the black pixels and the outline in the scene on the right. 
            <br><br>
            However, if you see Head and Tail move and get placed at the two sides of Box, so that their boundaries are aligned on the two sides, you will instantly see a complete but overstretched horse. Now consider: you never saw a Stretched Horse before, and you always saw non-stretched horses; you know that such an animal is biologically impossible (it would have trouble in negotiating turns); you further remember that it was built under your eyes by moving around Head and Tail; all of the above, but no matter what, still you cannot but see an overstretched horse partially occluded by Box when you are confronted with the scene. This means that vision has its own rules for deciding what is an object and what it is not, and ignores what other systems know or may think they know. 
            <br><br>
            The visual system in a sense is super smart, as it makes sense of complex scenes by simplifying them, in another sense it is super stubborn, as it cannot be corrected by what we know or think we know. Stubbornness is not bad in most contexts, as the important thing for the visual system is not to give a scientifically accurate representation of reality, but to react quickly with approximate representations that in turn make quick actions possible. This implies that the system will misfire in many contexts, in particular in non-natural contexts such as those created by humans. So it is important to understand that the rules for visually assembling objects are not what we think. 
            <br><br>
            <span class="box-text"> What are these rules? <span class="cite"> We still do not know completely. </span><span class="ref"> D. Hofmman, Visual Intelligence. P. Tse. Casati and Cavanagh, The visual world of shadows</span> You may think that the dominating rule for the stretched horse is “build an occlude object if you spot boundary alignment on the two sides of the occlusion”, and this surely will work fine in many occasions, but not in others. 
                Research is still ongoing.
