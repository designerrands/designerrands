        <p> We have seen above artist Ugo La Pietra trying to raise awareness about the sleep taboo. Let us delve a bit into the intricacies of the taboo.

            We somehow do not like people who sleep in some public places (the street, workplaces, libraries, shops) during office hours. Sleeping is (somewhat) tolerated on public transportation and in some designated hours and times, such as on benches in a public park at noon. This is partly a time issue, partly a space issue. You may be stigmatized if you told your colleagues that you went home for an afternoon nap (here no public space is involved). Some societies are more tolerant than other about this. However, the homeless can only sleep in the street, and still we do not seem to like it, as if they were doing something wrong, although they have no choice.
            <br><br>
            There are documented advantages of sleeping. For instance, sleep is extremely important for memory sedimentation. No clear disadvantages are associated to it, unless perhaps if you sleep too much. Sleep disruption causes problems. In some cases sleep is just a brute necessity. Your body knows better, and drivers may fall asleep suddenly and dangerously if they do not get enough rest. You maybe less efficient and make poor decisions if you are at a meeting and need some sleep. A <span class="design-type">self-design</span> suggestion: when driving long distance, drink a lot of water. This will force you to stop more often than your weak will wants you to.
