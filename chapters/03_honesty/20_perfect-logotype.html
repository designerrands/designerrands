      <p>
        You probably know this logo: Louis Vuitton iconic L and V mark. Few
        symbols in the world can match its worldwide notoriety and allure. From
        Paris to Abu Dhabi, from Milan to Moscow, there is no capital in the
        world without a Louis Vuitton store, manifestly located in their more
        elegant district. It is no mistery, and no surprise, that it is one of
        the most counterfeit brands on the planet, and that LVMH (Moët Hennessy
        Louis Vuitton SE, the French multinational luxury goods conglomerate
        that owns Louis Vuitton) devotes a substantial part of their
        communication budget to fight the forgers worldwide. The story goes that
        the design of the monogram itself was an idea by George Vuitton – Louis’
        son – to make life complicated for counterfeiters; and even the iconic
        flower and squared patterns that distinguish LV bags and accessories
        were designed with the same goal. There is no shortage of tutorials on
        line on how to spot a fake Louis Vuitton, and the discerning customer is
        alerted to check the quality of the leathers or fabrics, the stitchings
        and many other features in order to ascertain the authenticity of a
        Louis Vuitton bag. Once again, exhaustive online guides are available.
        So in example one can learn that if you see the logo letters anywhere
        truncated by edges or stitchings, that’s a fake: the LV monogram appear
        always intact no matter the size of the bags or how many time it is
        repeated in the pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly enough we did not find any mention of a very peculiar
        feature of the Louis Vuitton logo. A trait that is quite possibly
        invisible to everyone but type designers.
      </p>

      <h2>Can you find it?</h2>
      <div class="img-magnifier-container">
        <img
          id="myimage"
          src="data/20_lv-logo-mag.jpg"
          width="630"
          height="768"
          alt="LV-logo"
        />
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In the images below we have placed red arrows next to the brackets of
        the L and the V.
      </p>

      <img class="img-in-text" src="data/20_bracket1.png" />
      <br /><br />
      <img class="img-in-text" src="data/20_bracket2.png" />

      <p>
        The bracket is the curved connection between the stems (the long, mainly
        vertical strokes of the letter) and the serifs, their terminals (the
        pedestals and caps of a letter, so to speak). Now, in letters such as
        the ones used in this monogram, derived by the classical roman capitals,
        we would expect to see perfectly curved brackets connecting smoothly the
        serif to the stem. That is not the case in this logo: the imperfection
        in the connections is clearly visible in three instances once the logo
        is magnified: far from being a seamless transition from a curve into a
        straight line, we see a bulge where we would have expected a perfectly
        smooth curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sloppiness of the designer? That is highly unlikely considering that
        through the decades, and with the advent of digital typography, that
        could have been easily fine-tuned to the highest degree of perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more fascinating explanation is that this logo is deliberately left
        with a microscopic imperfection in order to detect forgeries: a
        counterfeiter using standard letters or templates attempting to
        reproduce the logo would probably end up with the “correct” bracket
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the surprises do not end here: there is, in support of this
        hypothesis, another very peculiar – once again almost invisible –
        feature in this monogram that would most likely not get copied correctly
        by a forger. But this one we would not divulge; let us know when you
        spot it.
