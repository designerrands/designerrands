        <p>Paper graffiti and tags have the advantage of being perishable. In no time rain and sun will reduce them in tatters. Not only an intelligent, more ecological alternative to paint; they are also a way to convey some respect for the place; they indicate that their authors think of themselves as passing guests, as experimenting with the place, as inviting a conversation on and about a wall that may or may not be improved through their intervention, letâ€™s see. Paint graffiti and tags have the irritating gift of permanence, they come with the request to last indefinitely, someone has decided for us that that wall needed that image. Even more irritating is the public commission of graffitis, a major symptom of paternalistic populism. The mayor knows better what the visual quality of our environment should be.
