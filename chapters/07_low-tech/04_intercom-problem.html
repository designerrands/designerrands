      <p>The old intercom interface had a number of buttons, one for each door inside, with names written next to each button. Its modern reincarnation sports a menu from which to choose the name of your party, as well as buttons for scrolling the menu and eventually calling. The operation is time consuming, it ill disposes (some of) the customers of businesses inside the building, and creates false positives for the other landlords and tenants. So, the medical practice choose to create a physical shortcut on the interface, a dedicated button, which serves as a direct link to their office. The solution is lower tech than that of the e-intercom. It is an anticipation of things to come: new practices cannot completely replace, and will mostly just displace, older practices. The residual is up for grabs, and fixes will come from many quarters.
