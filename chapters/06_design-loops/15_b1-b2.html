      <p>On the NYUAD Campus there are two residential buildings. They are named B1 and B2 and they are at the edge of campus on the North and South sides respectively. We also have two floors of underground parking lots that occupy all its surface, and they are also named B1 and B2. I leave to the reader to imagine the conversations: “My apartement in in B1, my car is parked in B1, far away from B1”.

      </p>
      <p>Puns aside, that is a real nuisance and a liability: If I have to report urgently that something happened in B1 or B2 that information alone would not be sufficient.
      </p>

      <p>While we wait for a better naming system, the visual design class intervened to alter the capital B of the signs in the basement so that they become P, which is, you know, the universal letter used for Parking.
