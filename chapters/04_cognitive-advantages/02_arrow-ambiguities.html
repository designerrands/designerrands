        Sailboats and motor boats drop and retrieve anchor from the bow. The
        operation is facilitated by an electric windlass. The two senses of
        rotation of the windlass determine whether the anchor will go down or
        up. Correspondingly, two simple buttons are necessary, an “up” button
        and a “down” button. “Up” and “down” describe the consequences of the
        motor operation. They tell us how the anchor moves. Of course, “up” and
        “down” are linguistic items, not icons, and they presuppose mastery –
        albeit elementary – of English.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the picture we see an alternate solution, arrows. This is the
        universal language of icons, one would assume. But what button would you
        push to retrieve the anchor?

      <p>
        The designer’s choice has been to associate the left arrow in the image above
        with “down”. The arrow indicates the direction of movement of the
        anchor’s chain. By pushing the left button, the chain unfurls and the
        anchor drops. The arrows do not directly refer to the end result
        (anchor’s dropping or being retrieved) but to the mechanism, a part of
        the causal history that leads to the anchor’s movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anchor operation is not trivial. The anchor may be stuck, a sailor may
        have to move it by hand, tension from the windlass may need to be
        released at very short notice, with various potential risks. There
        should be no room for time-consuming ambiguities.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should be noted that in this particular situation there is a further
        arrow ambiguity. When the chain is collected, typically the boat moves
        forward, in direction opposite to that of the arrow. The arrow can mean
        three things: where the boat is heading, the direction the chain’s
        movement, and the movement of the anchor.
