      <p>
        Restrooms are 236 meters from the sign. Not one meter more, not one
        less. How farther away is the restaurant? Look, then calculate:
        365m-236m=129m. And the policeman? He is 628m from here (but the
        direction he intimates is not the one we are prepared to go. He seems
        authoritative, though). Ah, looking more carefully, it looks as if the
        Management office, the Mosque and the Policeman are all at the same
        distance â€“ presumably in the same compound? That would have been good to
        know beforehand.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two types of costs involved in this interesting
        representation. The first we just presented: precise information is good
        (true, honest) but it may be difficult to assess, to compare and may
        hide patterns (such as the identical distance of Management, Police and
        Mosque. Well, it is so unlikely they are equidistant from here? Do the
        three offices coincide in space?)
      </p>

      <p>
        The second cost is related to the omnipresence of our relevance daemon
        inside. Typically, and reasonably, distances are provided in
        approximations
        <a href="../03_honesty/07_fahrenheit.html"
          >(see also Fahrenheint Responsibility)</a>. There must be a reason, the daemon surmises, for them being expressed
        in precise quantities. Suppose I told you, commenting upon skiing
        results, that three Italians were among the first ten. You do not
        thereby have an idea of the precise result of any of them. But suppose I
        tell you that three Italians were among the first eleven. Then you are
        entitled to at least prima facie conclude that one of them was the
        eleventh. Precision generates expectations and questions.
