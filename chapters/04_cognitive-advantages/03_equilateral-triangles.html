      <p>
        Equilateral triangles are very nice shapes, very appealing to graphic
        designers as they can be combined to make patterns in many ways. One
        area in which they should not be used is in Wayfinding, especially when
        they are used as arrows to indicate direction. The ambiguity of the
        information is apparent in the photo below, taken at the brand new
        Louvre Museum of Abu Dhabi. The plaza is on the right or upper left? The
        Auditorium is on the upper right, lower right or on the left?

      <p>(Update: The sign is gone one week after we tweeted about it, 2018)</p>

      <p>
        Attesting one more time the importance of raising this conversation in
        public space, it is remarkable that after few days after I took the
        photo and posted it on Twitter, the sign had been removed and corrected.
        Designer Erik Spiekermann was fast in offering criticism not only on the
        usage of equilateral triangles as arrows but also on how they were
        positioned in relation to the text.
