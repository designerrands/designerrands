        There is no principled reason why road use should be hierarchised: the
        big and the fast on top, with a number of implicit and explicit
        entitlements, the weak and slow at the bottom, bowing to the winners.
        The reasons, of course, are historical, the history being that of a
        power struggle. Modern roads have been designed for cars and trucks.
        Pedestrians would have a simple competitive advantage if all roads were
        unpaved and trail-like. But the very features that allow cars and trucks
        to ride create an opportunity for them to ride ever faster, at speeds
        that are incompatible with pedestrian and cyclist safety. (Bikers are in
        a limbo: they can at least use speed to protect themselves.) On modern
        road, the weak and the slow are protected by regulations and goodwill.

        Are they enough? Hardly. <span class="cite">Campaigns for road safety appear to be
          ineffective if they are not backed by measures.</span> <span class="ref">Girasek 2011 </span>  Designers should raise
        their voice here. What are the roads of the future? Segregation is the
        easy answer, but is coexistence possible? What is the correct structure
        of incentives to give an advantage to the weak?
