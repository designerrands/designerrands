        Several signs are scattered around the nyuad campus. Their placement is
        curious, strictly the result of remedial policies: one can almost get an
        accurate map of past infringements simply by looking at where the signs
        are. Their mood tone is perceived as dogmatic and aggressive: <em>No Smoking</em>
        and <em>Strictly No Smoking</em> area. 
        
        <br><br>
        Whenever we put a sign we should remember that the sign prescribes not only the policy itself (in this case that
        one cannot smoke on campus) but it also makes apparent the need of the
        policy reminder. A big NO SMOKING HERE sign in the cafeteria seems to
        suggest that we need to shout that out frequently to remind people of
        it. That is not the case: the instances of people actually smoking on
        campus are extremely rare. There is no need for a policing mood tone.
        The presence of signs just reflects badly on the institution and it
        risks to be ignored. Alternatives exist. Here is an example: a sign that
        day after day thanks the community, instead of policing the potential
        wrongdoer.

      <p>Content is the same, tone is different, hence the content will be read differently. It is most likely that the outcome will be different too.
