    </div>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>When traveling to India, Japan or Great Britain, the rest of the world must rapidly adjust to a new ecology – the world of driving on the left. And of course, people from those countries have the symmetric problem of adjusting to the world of driving on the right. In London, UK, pedestrians are made aware of the problem by signs on the pavement that invite one to “look right” or “look left” at crossings. Of course, every child on the planet knows enough English to understand those messages, don’t they. Here is a case in which the absence of a pictogram is really surprising. We invited Claudio Beorchia, an Italian artist and designer, to give his visual thoughts on the matter. The icons he produced, that are meant to be painted on the asphalt, ought to travel all over the world and reach out to all the pedestrian crossings in major cities.
