    <div class="main-text">
      <p>In NYU campus in Abu Dhabi, accessing a building via a five minutes walk can be a very pleasant experience during winter; and a really challenging one in the hot summer months. (As we have seen, this is why users have naturally found ‘desire paths’ among buildings: from back alleys to back alleys and so on. One more time, a desire path is the most practical route between an origin and destination.) 

      </p>

      <p>In the Spring 2015 the Wayfinding Class conducted a survey among the users of our Arts Center and found that one of the main requests was to facilitate the access between the Arts Center and the adjacent Campus Center: the service door in the photo does just that, providing a direct path between the two buildings, minimizing the outdoor path.
      </p>

      <p>That understandable desire seemed to contradict some preconceived ideas on where the desired paths on campus should be; instead of following the users requests some planners resorted to Surrealism, as the ultimate weapon against logic and user centered design. Behold the sign on the open door: <em>“This is not an entrance. This door does not open.”</em> But in reality that is a perfectly valid entrance – actually the users’ favourite one – and, yes the door does open.
      </p>

      <p>The questionable aspect of these signs did not escape the attention of our students either. For their end of term show they advertised their class work through a series of Hollywood blockbusters movie poster parodies that made all campus curious on the usually neglected topics of wayfinding and signage.
