      <p class="title">“In case of an emergency, look for the red window”
      </p>

    <div class="main-text">
      <p>On Milan green line metro, November 2016.
        <br><br>
        The time will come, you have to act in an emergency. Quick, what does the panel say? Text is too long, go for the picture! Quick! Powerful visual language!
      </p>

      <img class="img-in-text" src="data/19_red-window.jpeg" />
      <span class="credit"></span>

      <p>Here is what the picture meant to convey: top, pull the emergency handle down. Middle, open the case with the door-opening handle (in red). Bottom, pull the doors open. Further bottom, evacuate.
      </p>

      <p>Hey, not so fast. Notice how the shapes in Middle and Bottom are basically the same. The case of the door-opening handle looks almost exactly like the doors to be opened. You are surely entitled to infer from middle that you have to find a way out by pushing the window pane of the door.
      </p>

      <p>Last but not least, all the shapes are air-du-temps, rounded-angles rectangular smartphones. The computer metaphor is so strong, it also affects Top, where the handle system looks like a desktop PC. (Mind it, “handle”: why not use the powerful root, “hand”?)
      </p>

      <p>So this is how you can read it.
        <br><br>Top: here begins the story of the computer.
        <br><br>Arrow down, we move from red-screen desktop to red-screen smartphones (Middle).
        <br><br>Arrow down, choose between two cellphones (Bottom: actually, a step back from smartphones).
        <br><br>Further bottom: time to take a ride on a merry-go-round. Mind the inverted step.
        <br><br>Bob Noorda, R.I.P.
